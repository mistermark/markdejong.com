# Content is King

As with any good final release of a fancy new design also the vision of this website comes with a final thought of its author/creator. The reason why the redesign was necessary and the thoughts and theories that came with the process.


The basic thoughts behind the redesign of this blog is that I wanted to put the emphasis more on the content than its design. When you think about it, why are we looking at a website in the first place? It's not about that ad that you see to click on, or to communicate with that person on the other side of the world. It's basically because you want to know something. In essence this would be the *content* you'd be looking for.

Content makes up for the majority of the structure of a website and is the most important part that matters. For example, take any website you can think of right now. I bet when you go to that website the first thing you look at is the front page. What do you see on that front page? Yes, indeed. Content! It consists of various types of content, though. This can be images, text and video. But also the ads that you see (but actually try to ignore) are content. But they're just pieces of content people pay for to get it on there. But content nonetheless.

If we go to a webshop, for example, we're also looking at a lot of images and descriptions for the products it's selling. We're still looking at *content*. Just beyond those pieces of content is where we undertake our actions. For this webshop that would be the action of buying to get it into our own hands. For another website, like this blog for instance, it's a completely different one. Here the action can be to start a thinking process about something I've said in an article, or maybe even rethinking the way you are dealing with something at this moment.

Some websites are even focused on getting something *from* you, instead of getting something *to* you. Last year I've posted a blog about the [first time I actively participated in Movember](http://markdejong.com/) and this article could be an example of trying to get something from you. The goal for Movember is to raise awareness and money for men's health to support research for prostate and testicular cancer. So here I would've been trying to get money *from* you, instead of you trying to get something from me.

Of course there are also ways were the action can be a cross-action between the two ends. Take Facebook for example. This is definitely not just a one way street, at least not for the majority of the website. On Facebook we're posting messages to share with other people, but we're also trying to keep track of the messages our friends are posting. This is where we try to keep track of content, but also post content to inform our friends. This would be the social platform's most important action: content sharing.

To get back to the redesign of this blog. I've been trying to keep the focus to the content as much as possible without having other elements interfering with it. In the previous version of this blog I also added some visuals to brighten up the look and feel of it, but I found it's only cluttering up the space you're looking at. Thus I decided to get rid of all that and to keep the content as pure as possible with only a few visual elements to support the organisation of different content elements.

The result is this fine looking content orientated blog that's a pleasure to look at and lets you focus more on reading the content more than having other visual elements to distract you from doing just that.
